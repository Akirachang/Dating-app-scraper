# Reddit_Confessions

After unzipping the RedditConfessionsClassifier.zip file, run the confessionsclassifier.ipynb.
In this notebook, you will find the code that we used to clean the Tinder stories subreddit data.
Additional insights about the data have been highlighted as well.

Within the unzipped file, you will also find the code for scrapping the Reddit data of r/Tinder_Stories in ./scrapers/reddit_scraper.py

The config.py is for loading the Reddit API credentials like:
reddit_client_id = YOUR_REDDIT_CLIENT_ID
secret = YOUR_API_KEY
agent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0"
